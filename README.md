# Project Overview 
Study goal: Effect of Lecanemab on Alzheimer Patients' Sleep Regularity.
1. Build a program that calculates Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) with the input of time (epoch: 30 or 60sec) and Sleep status (sleep/wake).
2. Analyze the correlation between patients' SRI, baseline demographic, PSG, Neuropsychological data. 
3. Compare the SRI of the patients before and after the usage of Lecanemab. 
   
# Features

## Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) 
- The probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep or awake) at any two time points 24 h apart
  
## Weighted Hypoxemia Index 
- 
## RBDtector
- An open-source software designed to detect REM Sleep Without Atonia (RSWA)â€” a key diagnostic marker of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD).   
- A Python-based tool that analyzes raw polysomnography (PSG) data, especially electromyography (EMG) channels, to automatically identify muscle activity during REM sleep. It's built around the established SINBAR visual scoring criteria, covering tonic, phasic, and any EMG activity types.
